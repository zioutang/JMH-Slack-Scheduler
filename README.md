# Smart Reminder 



## The purpose of this project:

Productivity is hard to come by in fast-paced work environments.
Dozens of browsers tabs, desktop apps, and mobile notifications drown your ability to focus and concentrate. 
As companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon and IBM continue to build powerful AI-based platforms and tools, the barrier to applying machine learning to real user problems is becoming dramatically reduced. 
Scheduler Bot solves a real customer problem by streamlining workflow for a very large, immediately addressable market (teams who schedules meetings and use Slack) at the exact right time (advent of new powerful, easy-to-use AI technologies + proliferation of software tools used on job)


## Some key features:

• Built Intelligent Slack bot that allows creating Google Calendar invites and reminders using natural language queries.

• Architected interactive process for statefully managing multi-step chat interactions such as scheduling conflicts, cancellations, and confirmations.

• Implemented Slack Real-time Messaging API and interactive Messages to facilitate meeting and reminder creation within Slack.

• Designed seamless OAuth flow for Google Calendar inside Slack.

## Main Technologies Utilized:

API.AI; Node.js; Express; Google Calendar API; Slack real time npm package;
